# Task Manager

## Description
The Task Manager is a simple application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks. It is built with .NET and aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing daily tasks. The application can be used for personal task management or as a basis for more complex to-do list applications.
